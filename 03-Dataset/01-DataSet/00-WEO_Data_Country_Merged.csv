Historical data are in CY, but projections are converted by averaging two FYs (i.e. Avg[FY(t-1/t),FY(t/t+1)]= CY(t)). For example, the projection of 2027 is the average of 2026/27 and 2027/28. National accounts manual used: System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 GDP valuation: Market prices Reporting in calendar year: Yes. Historical calendar year data are calculated by adding up quarterly data from Haver. For example, the calendar year 2018 GDP is the sum of 2018Q1, 2018Q2,2018Q3 and 2018Q4 GDP data. The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December. Prior to 2009, the data are in fiscal year (FY) reporting basis converted to calendar year (CY) by averaging two FYs (e.g. CY2008 is the average of FY2007/08 and FY2008/09).

The change also includes methodological changes (for example, direct estimation of private consumption based on a survey) and most important, change in the index formulae (historically a Laspeyres fixed-base index and now a Laspeyres chain index). The main implications are that the 2005 and 2015 series are not comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components.

National accounts manual used: System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 GDP valuation: Market prices Reporting in calendar year: Yes. Historical calendar year data are calculated by adding up quarterly data from Haver. For example, the calendar year 2018 GDP is the sum of 2018Q1, 2018Q2,2018Q3 and 2018Q4 GDP data. The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December. Prior to 2009, the data are in fiscal year (FY) reporting basis converted to calendar year (CY) by averaging two FYs (e.g. CY2008 is the average of FY2007/08 and FY2008/09). Historical quarterly data are taken from Haver to have a smooth series. Base year: 2016. National Accounts were rebased on a FY basis and this rebasing was then applied to CY historical data. As a result real GDP and nominal GDP are not equal in CY 2016.

[Export and Import Price Index Manual: Theory and Practice, Glossary]",Percent change,Units,"Source: National Statistics Office. By the former Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia (CroStat), now the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (CBS, www.dzs.hr). Latest actual data: 2023 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher's, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres' and Paasche's formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports;. This statistics does not include temporary export and import (less than two years) of goods that are returned to the owner in an unaltered state, services, monetary gold, goods used as carriers of customized information including software and software downloaded from the Internet, means of payment which are legal tender and securities, goods supplied free of charge which are not the subject of commercial transactions (advertising material and commercial samples), supplying of Croatian diplomatic missions abroad and foreign diplomatic missions in the Republic of Croatia, and temporary exports and imports for repair. For 2016, transaction imports below 1.8 million Kuna and exports below 0.9 million Kuna are exempted from statistical reports. Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other; Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is increased by the costs incurred from the place of delivery in Croatia to the Croatian border. Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF). The import values are calculated on the basis of the CIF parity. It means that the invoice value is increased by transportation and other costs incurred from the place of delivery abroad to the Croatian border, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is reduced for the costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery in Croatia.

Due to internal tax changes in Russia, this discount is projected to gradually fall to zero by the end of 2024. Current WEO projections for Belarus are based on information provided by the authorities on a bilateral oil price deal with Russia that is being negotiated, but is not yet formally signed. The dynamics of the imported oil price deflator is set by world prices as well as by the discount, so it does not follow world prices.

[Export and Import Price Index Manual: Theory and Practice, Glossary]",Percent change,Units,"Source: National Statistics Office. By the former Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia (CroStat), now the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (CBS, www.dzs.hr). Latest actual data: 2023 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher's, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres' and Paasche's formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports;. This statistics does not include temporary export and import (less than two years) of goods that are returned to the owner in an unaltered state, services, monetary gold, goods used as carriers of customized information including software and software downloaded from the Internet, means of payment which are legal tender and securities, goods supplied free of charge which are not the subject of commercial transactions (advertising material and commercial samples), supplying of Croatian diplomatic missions abroad and foreign diplomatic missions in the Republic of Croatia, and temporary exports and imports for repair. For 2016, transaction imports below 1.8 million Kuna and exports below 0.9 million Kuna are exempted from statistical reports. Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other; Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is increased by the costs incurred from the place of delivery in Croatia to the Croatian border. Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF). The import values are calculated on the basis of the CIF parity. It means that the invoice value is increased by transportation and other costs incurred from the place of delivery abroad to the Croatian border, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is reduced for the costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery in Croatia.
