Historical data are in CY, but projections are converted by averaging two FYs (i.e. Avg[FY(t-1/t),FY(t/t+1)]= CY(t)). For example, the projection of 2027 is the average of 2026/27 and 2027/28. National accounts manual used: System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 GDP valuation: Market prices Reporting in calendar year: Yes. Historical calendar year data are calculated by adding up quarterly data from Haver. For example, the calendar year 2018 GDP is the sum of 2018Q1, 2018Q2,2018Q3 and 2018Q4 GDP data. The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December. Prior to 2009, the data are in fiscal year (FY) reporting basis converted to calendar year (CY) by averaging two FYs (e.g. CY2008 is the average of FY2007/08 and FY2008/09). Historical quarterly data are taken from Haver to have a smooth series. Base year: 2016. National Accounts were rebased on a FY basis and this rebasing was then applied to CY historical data. As a result real GDP and nominal GDP are not equal in CY 2016.

Notes: Due to the prevalence of multiple exchange rates and a parallel market, for 2012-2023, staff has computed a generalized unitary exchange rate weighted by the value of imports and exports as well as by the different windows used to acquire foreign exchange. Starting in 2012, staff estimates the nominal GDP in local currency using real GDP levels published by the country and deflators calculated by staff. Nominal GDP in U.S. dollars is calculated dividing the local currency GDP by the generalized unitary exchange rate.
